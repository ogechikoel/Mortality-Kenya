# Mortality-Kenya
This repository contains a Shiny app that I created to visualize neonatal, infant, child, and under-five mortality in Kenya for the years 2014 and 2022. It also includes the dataset used to develop the app. As for the shapefiles, they can be accessed from various online platforms.
